## 🔄 Complete Value Cycle (6-Step Business Model)

```
1. 🤖 AI generates memes from trending crypto news
    ↓
2. 👥 Users vote → Earn 8-15 tickets (FREE participation)
    ↓
3. 🏆 Community decides winner & rarity (Common → Legendary)
    ↓
4. 💎 Daily winner becomes NFT → Auction (scarcity-driven)
    ↓
5. 💰 Auction revenue → Prize pool (80% to users, 20% operations)
    ↓
6. 🎰 Sunday 8PM UTC → SOL distribution to ticket holders
```

### Key Features

#### 🎨 AI-Powered Content Creation
- **Daily Fresh Content**: 3 new memes daily from crypto/tech trends
- **News Integration**: Twitter trends, CoinDesk, Reddit r/CryptoCurrency
- **Quality AI**: Gemini API for high-quality, relevant memes
- **Trend-Aware**: Real-time integration of crypto market events

#### 🗳️ Two-Phase Democratic Voting
- **Phase 1**: Choose the best meme (winner selection)
- **Phase 2**: Decide winner's rarity level (Common/Rare/Legendary)
- **Instant Rewards**: 8-15 random tickets per complete vote
- **Streak Bonuses**: Additional rewards for consecutive daily voting
- **Zero Cost**: Completely free, wallet connection only

#### 💎 Scarcity-Driven Economics
- **Daily Limit**: Only 1 NFT minted per day (highest rarity winner)
- **Auction System**: 3-day auctions with transparent bidding
- **Fair Distribution**: 80% auction revenue → user prize pool
- **Sustainable Model**: 20% platform fee for operations and growth

## 🏆 Rarity System & Economics

| Rarity Level | Starting Bid | Community Impact |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Common** | 0.01 SOL | Accessible entry point |
| **Rare** | 0.03 SOL | Mid-tier value creation |
| **Legendary** | 0.1 SOL | Premium content recognition |

### 🎫 Reward Mechanism
- **Random Tickets**: 8-15 tickets per complete vote
- **Fair Distribution**: Based on ticket count, not rarity voted
- **Weekly Draws**: Every Sunday 8PM UTC
- **Transparent Payouts**: All distributions recorded on-chain
