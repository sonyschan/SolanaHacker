# MVP UX Improvements Requirements

## Current State
- **Combined Score**: 76% (78% desktop, 72% mobile)
- **Target**: 90% for MVP completion
- **Platform**: MemeForge - AI meme voting with SOL rewards

## Critical Issues to Fix

### Desktop Issues (78% → 90%+)
1. **No clear CTA button visible for voting**
   - Current: Vote buttons blend into meme cards
   - Fix: Add prominent, centered "VOTE NOW" section above memes
   - Design: Large, gradient button with countdown timer

2. **Stats layout feels cramped**
   - Current: 3 stats cards with tight spacing
   - Fix: Better spacing, larger touch targets
   - Design: Add more breathing room, improve typography

3. **Missing visual feedback for countdown timer**
   - Current: Small text showing "18:42:33 left"
   - Fix: Prominent countdown with visual urgency
   - Design: Large timer with progress bar or circle

### Mobile Issues (72% → 90%+)
1. **Wallet connection flow not intuitive**
   - Current: "Connect wallet to vote" appears too early
   - Fix: Show preview/demo before requiring connection
   - Design: "Try Demo" → "Connect to Earn" flow

2. **Limited voting mechanism explanation**
   - Current: FAQ hidden, concepts unclear
   - Fix: Inline explanations and visual guides
   - Design: Progressive disclosure with tooltips

3. **SOL earning relationship unclear**
   - Current: Complex lottery ticket concept
   - Fix: Simplified "Vote → Earn → Win" messaging
   - Design: Visual flow diagram
