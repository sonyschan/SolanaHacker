- **Task**: #5. bug: browser log error - installHook.js:1 Encountered two children with the same key, MetaMask. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted — the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.

## Summary
Fixed React key duplication error for wallet adapters by implementing absolutely unique identifiers in walletSingleton.js. Modified wallet adapter creation to use unique keys (counter + timestamp + random) while preserving display names for UI. Added multiple layers of deduplication and React key safety checks. Verified fix resolves the "Encountered two children with the same key, MetaMask" console error.
