- **Task**: #5. 重構 Dashboard 導航結構，將其命名為：1. Forge (Vote) -> 2. My Tickets (Inventory) -> 3. Market (NFT Auctions)。這三個標籤頁應對應你的價值循環，確保用戶在導航中就能理解整個商業邏輯。 _(added: 2026-02-08)_

## Summary
Successfully restructured Dashboard navigation with three clear tabs: 1. Forge (Vote) - where users vote on memes, 2. My Tickets (Inventory) - view user's voting tickets and rewards, 3. Market (NFT Auctions) - future marketplace for NFT trading. The navigation clearly communicates the value loop and business logic flow. Also integrated the Dashboard component into main App.jsx and verified it works on both desktop and mobile.
