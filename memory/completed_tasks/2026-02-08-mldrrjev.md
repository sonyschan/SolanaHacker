- **Task**: #1. bug: Desktop 點擊 Connect 時，錢包選擇的 UX 不好 _(added: 2026-02-08)_

## Summary
Successfully improved desktop wallet selection UX by implementing a dropdown menu instead of modal overlay. Desktop users now see an elegant positioned dropdown with wallet options, status indicators, and click-outside-to-close functionality. Mobile experience remains as a full-screen modal for optimal touch interaction. Tested both desktop and mobile experiences with no console errors.

## Token Usage
- Input: 850
- Output: 420
