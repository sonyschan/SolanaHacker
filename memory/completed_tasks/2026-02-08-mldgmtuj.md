- **Task**: #5. bug: 錢包登入 點擊 Connect -> 選 OKX Wallet (detected) -> Connect -> Wallet show connected -> 頁面上還是顯示 ‘Connect’ button, 不像上一次我看到成功login 的錢包地址還有 logout 按鈕 _(added: 2026-02-08)_

## Summary
Fixed wallet connection UI state issue where page continued showing 'Connect' button after successful OKX wallet connection. Root cause was conditional children text overriding EnhancedWalletButton's internal display logic. Button now properly shows connected wallet address and logout button as expected.

## Token Usage
- Input: 15200
- Output: 2800
