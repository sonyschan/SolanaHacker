## Website Structure Proposal Delivered

H2Crypto asked for a website structure proposal based on our product spec. I analyzed the 6-step value cycle and proposed:

**3-Tab Navigation:**
1. **Forge** - Core voting (Steps 1-3: AI generation → User voting → Decide winner/rarity)
2. **My Tickets** - User rewards (Step 6: Reward distribution) 
3. **Market** - NFT trading (Steps 4-5: NFT minting → Auction system)

**Key Design Principles:**
- Direct mapping from value cycle to user interface
- Intuitive flow: Forge → Tickets → Market
- Clear separation of concerns
- Mobile-friendly tab structure

This proposal aligns perfectly with our MemeForge product specification and provides a logical user journey through our 6-step value cycle.

## Website Structure Design Saved to Knowledge Base

H2Crypto instructed me to save the website structure design to knowledge/ for future development reference.

**File Created**: `knowledge/website-structure.md` 

**Content Includes**:
- Complete 3-tab navigation architecture (Forge/Tickets/Market)
- Detailed component breakdown for each tab
- User experience flow mapping
- Technical implementation hierarchy
- Mobile optimization strategies
- Development phase priorities

**Purpose**: This will serve as the complete blueprint for future development work, ensuring consistency with our 6-step MemeForge value cycle and providing detailed guidance for implementation.

The structure is now permanently saved and ready to guide future #dotask development work.
